	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure</h1>

	<h4>What?</h4>
	<p>This lab deals with structuring files when creating an HTML/CSS web page project.</p>

	<h4>Challenges?</h4>
	<p>The creative side of my brain isn't my strong point so trying to make a good looking page is tough.</p>

	<h4>Results:</h4>
	<p>I believe the page you are currently reading is the result of this lab. Images from the lab can be seen below:</p>

	<img src="img/lab3_task3Code.PNG">
	<p>Code from this very page... Before I added these images</p>
