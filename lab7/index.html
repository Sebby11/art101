		<h3>Challenge</h3>
		<p>We were tasked with making a function that could take a user's name as input, sorting it alphabetically, and displaying it on the HTML page.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>Figuring out using the function within window.prompt() was a little confusing so that needed to be looked up. Figuring out how to keep uppercase and lowercase letters together while sorting was a little tricky. Overall it was a good lab.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<div class=output>
			<h5>Script output:</h5>
			<p>Your sorted name is listed below:</p>
        	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
		</div>
