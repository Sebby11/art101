			<h3>Challenge</h3>
			<p>In this lab we were tasked with finding portions of code not working in previous labs and ultimately fix them. If there were not bugs, which was my case, then we were to try debugging within the console and try to answer a question on Stack Overflow.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="problem">
			<h3>Problems</h3>
			<p>The only real problem with this lab was finding a question on Stack Overflow that I felt confident enough to answer. The question I answered felt appropriate as p5.js is a Javascript library I have used.</p>
