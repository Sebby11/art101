		<h5>Alexa:</h5>
		<p>Hello! I am a first-year student who is in the process of declaring AGPM as my major. In my spare time, I enjoy playing games like Halo and Risk of Rain, as well as the process of creating 2d and 3d art for video games. I'm always curious to learn more about anything, programming currently being one of them.</p>

		<h5>Sebastian:</h5>

		<p>I am a 4th year student studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. In my free time I enjoy messing around on different programming projects and playing with my dog. My dog's name is Bentley and I've attached a photo of him below. Hope you enjoy!</p>
