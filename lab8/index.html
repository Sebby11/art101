		<h3>Challenge</h3>
		<p>We were tasked with creating general and 
		anonymous functions within Javascript then map
		those to an already created number array.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>The bigges problem came when trying to place the 
		script output to the results section of the web page 
		while the script tag was in the HTML head element. In 
		the end we figured out we needed to use the onload function in order to access elements within the body of the HTML document.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<div class=output>
			<h5>Script output:</h5>
			<p id="array">Placeholder</p>
			<p id="addFunc"></p>
			<p id="modFunc"></p>
		</div>
