		<h3>Challenge</h3>
		<p>In this lab we were tasked with created a program that takes the name of a use using HTML elements and outputs the user's Harry Potter house according to their name.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>There were major problems within this lab. One potential problem we ran into was if we actually needed to use conditionals or if we could use an array that corresponds to our modulo value. In the end we decided to use conditionals as that is what the lab was about.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
