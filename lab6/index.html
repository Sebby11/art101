		<h3>Challenge</h3>
		<p>We were tasked with using Javascript to create an array representing our modes of travel and an object refrenceing our main mode of tranportation.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>Some problems arose when creating the javascript project; for example, in the the canvas screenshots if showed age as a reference to a function but we couldn't figure this out. Although, overall we felt as though the lab went smoothly.</p>
