		<h3>Challenge</h3>
		<p>In this lab we were required to add HTML elements to our main index.html through javascript.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>There were no real problems with this lab as we did some of the same work in the previous lab. The only real problem is that my partner and I didn't have much time to get together to work. Although, I think it worked out well.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
